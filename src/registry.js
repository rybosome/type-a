 * class itself becomes unreachable (important for test isolation and module
 * hot-reloading).
 *
 * The concrete registration helpers (`nestedArray`, `nestedVariant`) live on
 * {@link Schema} and simply write into the registry instance supplied (or the
 * {@link defaultRegistry} when none is provided).
